What Are Pytest Plugins?
Pytest plugins are modular extensions that hook into Pytestâ€™s internal lifecycle. They can:

    Add new CLI options
    Modify test collection or execution
    Enhance reporting
    Provide custom fixtures
    Integrate with external tools (like coverage, HTML reports, CI systems)

Pytest uses a hook-based architecture powered by the pluggy library.
Plugins register functions to respond to specific events like test setup, teardown, or result reporting.

How Pytest Loads Plugins -->
Pytest discovers plugins in several ways:
    Method	                            Description
    Built-in	                        Comes with Pytest (e.g. assertion rewriting, test discovery)
    conftest.py	                        Local plugins scoped to a directory
    pytest_plugins variable	            Declares plugins to load in conftest.py or test modules
    -p plugin_name CLI option	        Explicitly loads a plugin
    entry_points in pyproject.toml	    Used for distributable plugins via PyPI

You can inspect active plugins with:
    pytest --trace-config

To disable a plugin:
    pytest -p no:plugin_name
